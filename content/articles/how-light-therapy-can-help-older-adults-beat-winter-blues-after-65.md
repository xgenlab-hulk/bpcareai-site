# How Light Therapy for Seasonal Depression Can Brighten Winter Days After 65

As the days get shorter and sunlight becomes scarce, many older adults notice a shift in their mood—feeling more tired, less motivated, or even down without a clear reason. This is often linked to seasonal depression in older adults, especially after age 65. One of the most effective, non-invasive tools to help with this? Light therapy for seasonal depression. Also known as bright light therapy or phototherapy, it uses special light boxes to mimic natural outdoor light and can help regulate your body’s internal clock.

While some people brush off winter blues as just “part of getting older,” that’s a misconception. Feeling low during darker months isn’t inevitable—and it’s not something you just have to live with. Another common myth is that only younger people benefit from light therapy. In reality, studies show that seniors respond well to treatment when used correctly, and it can significantly improve daily functioning and emotional well-being.

## Why Seasonal Depression Affects Older Adults Differently

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is more than just winter sadness—it’s a type of depression that follows a seasonal pattern, typically starting in fall and lasting through winter. For older adults, the impact can be more pronounced due to natural changes in circadian rhythm and reduced exposure to daylight. As we age, our eyes let in less light, and our brains may become less responsive to the signals that help regulate sleep and mood.

Reduced sunlight disrupts the balance of key brain chemicals like serotonin and melatonin. Serotonin, which influences mood, tends to drop when there’s less daylight. Melatonin, which helps control sleep, can increase too much, leading to fatigue and oversleeping. These shifts are often behind the symptoms of seasonal depression in older adults: low energy, difficulty concentrating, increased need for sleep, and a tendency to withdraw socially.

It’s also important to note that symptoms can overlap with other conditions common in later life—like thyroid issues, vitamin D deficiency, or even early signs of dementia. That’s why proper assessment is key. If you’ve felt persistently down for more than two weeks each winter for the past couple of years, it might be more than just a case of cabin fever.

## How Light Therapy for Seasonal Depression Works

Light therapy boxes are designed to emit a bright, full-spectrum light that mimics sunlight—without the harmful UV rays. When used properly, this light helps reset your internal clock (also called your circadian rhythm), which can improve both mood and sleep patterns.

The recommended strength for effective treatment is a light box that delivers **10,000 lux** of light. For comparison, indoor lighting usually ranges between 300 and 500 lux, while a sunny day can reach up to 50,000 lux. Using a 10,000-lux light box for about **20 to 30 minutes each morning**—ideally within an hour of waking—can produce noticeable improvements in mood within a few days to two weeks.

To get the best results:
- Sit about 16 to 24 inches from the light box
- Keep your eyes open, but don’t stare directly at the light
- Use it consistently every day during the darker months
- Morning use tends to be most effective; evening use may interfere with sleep

Not all light boxes are created equal, so look for ones labeled “for SAD” or “for seasonal depression.” Avoid tanning beds or UV lamps—they’re not safe or effective for this purpose.

## Practical Tips for Getting Started with Light Therapy

Starting light therapy doesn’t have to be complicated. Here are a few lifestyle tips to make it work better:
- Combine your light therapy session with a morning routine—like having coffee, reading the news, or doing a crossword puzzle. This makes it easier to stick with.
- Try to pair it with other mood-supporting habits: gentle exercise, staying socially connected, and eating balanced meals rich in omega-3s and vitamin D.
- Keep your environment brighter during the day by opening curtains and using full-spectrum light bulbs at home.

Self-monitoring can make a big difference. Consider jotting down how you feel each day—energy levels, sleep quality, mood—for a few weeks before and after starting therapy. This helps you see patterns and track what’s working.

If you have existing eye conditions (like macular degeneration) or are on medications that increase light sensitivity (such as certain antipsychotics or antibiotics), talk to your doctor first. While light therapy is generally safe, it’s always wise to check when managing multiple health concerns.

Signs you should see a doctor include persistent feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, or thoughts of self-harm. Depression—even seasonal—is treatable, and combining light therapy with counseling or medication can offer even greater relief.

Tracking your blood pressure trends can help you and your doctor make better decisions. Consider keeping a daily log or using a monitoring tool to stay informed.

## A Brighter Winter Is Possible

If you've been feeling sluggish or down each winter, know that you're not alone—and there are steps you can take. Light therapy for seasonal depression is a simple, evidence-based option that many older adults find helpful. With consistent use and a little patience, it can make gray days feel a bit more manageable. If you're unsure, talking to your doctor is always a good idea.

### FAQ

#### What is light therapy for seasonal depression and how does it work?
Light therapy for seasonal depression uses a special light box to deliver bright, artificial light that mimics natural sunlight. This helps regulate your body’s internal clock and boosts mood-related brain chemicals like serotonin, which tend to dip during darker months.

#### How long should I use a light box each day?
Most people benefit from 20 to 30 minutes of light therapy each morning using a 10,000-lux light box. Consistency matters—using it daily throughout fall and winter gives the best results.

#### Can older adults over 65 use light therapy safely?
Yes, light therapy is generally safe for seniors. However, if you have eye conditions or take light-sensitive medications, consult your doctor before starting. Many older adults report improved energy and mood with regular use.

#### What time of day is best for light therapy?
Morning use—within an hour of waking—is typically most effective. It helps align your circadian rhythm and reduces the risk of interfering with sleep. Avoid using it late in the evening.

#### Are there side effects of light therapy for seasonal depression?
Some people experience mild side effects like eye strain, headache, or agitation, especially at first. These usually go away with shorter sessions or adjusting the distance from the light. If side effects persist, talk to your healthcare provider.
