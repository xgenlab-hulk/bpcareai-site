# Understanding Heart Disease in Hispanic Adults Over 50

Heart disease remains a leading cause of death across the United States, and heart disease in Hispanic adults over 50 is a growing concern. While many assume that this group has lower overall rates compared to non-Hispanic whites, recent data shows that certain types of cardiovascular issues—especially related to high blood pressure and diabetes—are more prevalent and often go undetected longer. This can lead to delayed care and poorer outcomes. Another common misconception is that genetics alone determine risk, when in reality, lifestyle, access to healthcare, and cultural habits play powerful roles.

The good news? Awareness and early action make a significant difference. By understanding the unique combination of factors affecting Hispanic adults as they age, it’s possible to take meaningful steps toward better heart health—no matter your background or current condition.

## Why Heart Disease in Hispanic Adults Over 50 Requires Special Attention

Several interconnected factors contribute to higher risks of heart disease in Hispanic adults over 50. These include genetic predispositions, cultural influences on diet and activity levels, and social determinants like access to preventive care.

Genetically, some Hispanic subgroups—particularly those with Indigenous American ancestry—may have a higher tendency to develop insulin resistance, which increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. Since diabetes is a major contributor to heart disease, this creates an important link. In fact, the CDC reports that Hispanic adults are about 50% more likely to die from heart disease than non-Hispanic whites, especially between ages 45 and 64.

Culturally, traditional diets rich in refined carbohydrates (like white rice, tortillas, and fried foods), combined with decreasing physical activity after retirement or due to work demands, can elevate blood pressure and cholesterol. Language barriers, lack of insurance, or distrust in the medical system may also delay regular check-ups, allowing conditions like hypertension—often called the “silent killer”—to progress unnoticed.

It's important to note that "Hispanic" encompasses diverse backgrounds including Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central and South American communities, each with slightly different health profiles. For example, Puerto Rican and Dominican populations tend to have higher rates of asthma and obesity, both linked to increased cardiovascular strain.

## Key Risk Factors You Should Know

Three primary areas significantly influence heart disease risk in this population: metabolic health, lifestyle patterns, and healthcare access.

**Metabolic Syndrome** is especially common among Hispanic adults over 50. It includes a cluster of conditions—high blood pressure (above 130/80 mm Hg), elevated fasting blood sugar, excess abdominal fat, and abnormal cholesterol levels. Having three or more of these doubles your risk for heart attack or stroke. Studies show nearly 30% of Hispanic adults meet criteria for metabolic syndrome, one of the highest rates in the U.S.

**Lifestyle habits** also play a key role. Family-centered meals are a beautiful part of Hispanic culture, but when centered around high-sodium, high-fat dishes, they can impact arterial pressure over time. Additionally, smoking rates vary by subgroup, with Cuban and Puerto Rican men showing higher tobacco use, further increasing cardiovascular strain.

Lastly, **healthcare access** affects early detection. About 19% of Hispanic adults lack consistent health coverage, making routine screenings for blood pressure, cholesterol (LDL above 100 mg/dL is a concern), and A1C (a measure of long-term blood sugar) less frequent. Without these, warning signs go unaddressed until symptoms appear—sometimes too late.

Those who are overweight, have a family history of heart disease, or were diagnosed with gestational diabetes during pregnancy should be especially proactive about monitoring their heart health.

## Practical Steps to Support Your Heart Health

The great thing about heart disease risk is that most factors can be improved—even later in life. Small, consistent changes add up over time and can significantly reduce your chances of serious complications.

Start with **diet**: gradually shift toward more whole grains (like brown rice or quinoa), fresh vegetables, lean proteins such as beans, fish, or skinless poultry, and healthy fats like avocado and olive oil. Try using herbs and spices instead of salt to flavor traditional dishes—many find they prefer the taste once adjusted.

**Physical activity** doesn’t require a gym. Aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, dancing (a joyful option in many Hispanic households!), or gardening. Even breaking it into 10-minute segments counts.

If you smoke, quitting is one of the best things you can do for your heart. Within just one year, your risk of heart disease drops by half. Talk to your doctor about support programs or nicotine replacement options.

Managing stress through mindfulness, prayer, or spending time with loved ones also supports cardiovascular wellness. Chronic stress raises cortisol levels, which can increase blood pressure and inflammation over time.

Tracking your blood pressure trends can help you and your doctor make better decisions. Consider keeping a daily log or using a monitoring tool to stay informed.

See your doctor if you experience unexplained fatigue, shortness of breath during light activity, chest discomfort, swelling in legs or ankles, or consistently high blood pressure readings (consistently above 130/80 mm Hg).

Remember, heart disease in Hispanic adults over 50 is manageable with awareness and action. If you're unsure, talking to your doctor is always a good idea.

### FAQ

#### What are the main causes of heart disease in Hispanic adults over 50?

The main causes include a combination of higher rates of type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, culturally influenced dietary patterns, lower physical activity levels, and limited access to preventive healthcare. Genetic factors may also increase susceptibility to insulin resistance and high blood pressure.

#### Are Hispanic adults over 50 at higher risk for heart disease?

While overall heart disease mortality has historically been lower in Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic whites (a phenomenon known as the "Hispanic paradox"), recent trends show rising rates—especially due to diabetes and obesity. Hispanic adults over 50 are now facing increased risk, particularly for complications related to untreated hypertension and delayed diagnosis.

#### How can I reduce my risk of heart disease after 50?

You can reduce your risk by maintaining a balanced diet low in sodium and processed foods, staying physically active, managing stress, avoiding tobacco, and getting regular check-ups. Monitoring blood pressure and blood sugar regularly helps catch problems early.

#### Is high blood pressure common in Hispanic adults over 50?

Yes, high blood pressure is quite common. Nearly 40% of Hispanic adults over 50 have hypertension, but only about half have it under control. Because high blood pressure often has no symptoms, routine screening is essential.

#### What should I discuss with my doctor about heart disease prevention?

Talk to your doctor about your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, blood sugar (A1C test), weight, and family history. Ask how often you should be screened and whether lifestyle changes or medications could help reduce your risk of heart disease in Hispanic adults over 50.
